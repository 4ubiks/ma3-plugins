# Work in Process Plugins

# Unfinished Plugins
## patchOrganize.lua (WIP):
Plugin will take all objects in the patch, if they are not grouped, create groups for each, and put them into respective groups, while keeping the addresses and universes intact. It's an organizational tool for LDs with a crowded patch

<br>

## smalls.lua:
Just small code snippets that do little, but important things. An example, I saved the line of code that returns the name of the current showfile. 
<br>
<br>

## testZone.lua:
When building applications, you sometimes need to test small parts of it. That is to be done here. I do not save anything I want to remember long-term in here.

## references folder:
All plugins and code used from external resources. I do not claim to have authored any files inside of this folder, but you'll very likely find some helpful tricks and tools in here.
